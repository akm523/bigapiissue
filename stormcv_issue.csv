I've checked the source code and try to change some parameter (frameskip, framerate, etc), but the result is all the same.Then I wonder if it because my computer is a little bit old ,so I run it on a server(intel i7,  nvidea 1080 && 64G RAM),but it's still not change.
I still use the xuggle not  Humble-Video, so is it the reason?
So could you please tell me how can I make the streaming more fluid.
I'm a begginner of storm ,from China. I would appreciate it if you can reply."
