The index of offsets is important to implement InputSplit in Hadoop
efficiently. Prior to this commit, HipiImageBundle uses one big file
and very simple file format: (signature, next needle length, next needle
type, needle binary blob until EOF) which doesn't have index of offsets
embedded in the file. This commit fixed the problem by introducing two
file structure: a index file and a dat file. The normal assigned Path
in open will designate index file only. The index file structure is a
bit more craftied in the sense that may support extended functionalities
in the future:

The first 4-byte is 0x81911b18, as signature for hipi bundle
the following 2-byte records the length of data filename (with
assumption that it will live in the same directory as index file)
the following various bytes will have data filename encoded in UTF-8
a following 8-byte will record image count (-1 for unknown)
following 16-byte is ""reserved"" field
following 4-byte is skip length, meaning how much should be skipped
before the start of offset record (you may have more data in between)
then, there starts offset record until EOF

The data file is simplified as only having image length, image type and
image blob. Conceptually, you can concatenate two data file togather if
you file system support such operation atomically.

The best part of current design is, you can even ignore concatenation
operation when do merge (another important operation we eventually
needs to support) by having index file to index several files at once
(using reserve fields and skipped fields). Since index file is much
smaller than actual data file, the operation can be fast.

The downside, of course, is the fact that we have two files in the
system rather than one which may affect the durability of our bundle.
The good news is, index file can always recovered from data file, but
takes some time.
